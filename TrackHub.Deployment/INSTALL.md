## Overview

TrackHub is a GPS tracking and monitoring platform consisting of:

| Component | Description | Technology |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **TrackHub** | Web frontend | React.js |
| **AuthorityServer** | Identity provider | .NET 10, OpenIddict |
| **TrackHubSecurity** | Security & user management | .NET 10, GraphQL |
| **TrackHub.Manager** | Asset management | .NET 10, GraphQL |
| **TrackHubRouter** | Device routing | .NET 10, GraphQL |
| **TrackHub.Geofencing** | Geofence management | .NET 10, GraphQL |
| **TrackHub.TripManagement** | Trip planning, route planning & tolls | .NET 10, GraphQL |
| **TrackHub.Telemetry** | Position & telemetry store | .NET 10, GraphQL |
| **TrackHub.Reporting** | Reports generation | .NET 10, REST API |
| **SyncWorker** | Background data-sync service | .NET 10, Worker (no HTTP) |
| **nginx** | Reverse proxy, SSL termination | nginx:alpine |
| **db-init** | One-shot **seeder** (data only — never schema) | .NET 10, run once per deploy |

**Document management** is part of **TrackHub.Manager**: uploads, versioning, signatures,
sharing, plus scan/expiration/retention background jobs. Files are stored on the
`manager-documents` Docker volume by default (`DocumentStorage__Provider=LocalFileSystem`),
or in S3 / Azure Blob — see [Configuration Reference](#configuration-reference). Uploads are
capped at **50 MB** by nginx (`client_max_body_size`). This volume is the only stateful data
outside PostgreSQL: back it up separately.

## Prerequisites

### Server Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 2 cores | 4+ cores |
| RAM | 4 GB + 4 GB swap (image builds) | 8+ GB |
| Storage | 20 GB | 50+ GB SSD |
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS | Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS |

> **Note:** Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS is the default and recommended operating system. Other Debian-based distributions may work but are not officially tested.

### Software Requirements

| Software | Minimum Version | Recommended |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Docker Engine | 24.0+ | Latest stable |
| Docker Compose | v2.20+ | Latest stable |
| Git | 2.34+ | Latest stable |
| OpenSSL | 3.0+ | Latest stable |
| .NET SDK | 10.0 | 10.0 (build only) |

> **Note:** Docker builds include the .NET SDK automatically, but you still need the SDK
> (plus `dotnet-ef`) on a host that can reach PostgreSQL, because **EF migrations are applied
> outside Docker** — see [Applying Migrations](#applying-migrations). TrackHubCommon needs
> no setup on that host: the services reference it as a `ProjectReference`, so restore and
> build resolve it straight from the source in the checkout — the same way the Docker
> image builds do.

### External Requirements

- Registered domain name (or static IP for internal deployments)
- PostgreSQL 14+ database server (external, already installed and operational)
- SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt recommended for production)
- **An OpenRouteService API key or a self-hosted ORS instance** — required by
  TripManagement, see [OpenRouteService Provisioning](#openrouteservice-provisioning-required)

#### OpenRouteService Provisioning (required)

TripManagement plans routes through **OpenRouteService**. An **API key or a self-hosted ORS
instance is a REQUIRED per-deployment dependency** and must be provisioned before this module
can be released. It is the module's only hard external prerequisite and is obtainable
**same-day** from the free public plan at <https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/signup>;
self-hosting is supported by pointing `ORS_BASE_URL` at your own instance.

**Absence of configuration is a deployment error, not a supported operating mode.** At
runtime it degrades rather than blocks: route planning returns `RoutePlan.Failed` +
`ROUTING_NOT_CONFIGURED`, ETAs fall back to `EtaSource = Planned`, and trips remain fully
usable — they simply never receive a planned route, distance, duration or corridor. Do not
treat that degraded state as "working".

Configure it in `.env` (see the ROUTE PLANNING block in `.env.example`):

```bash
ROUTING_PROVIDER=OpenRouteService
ORS_BASE_URL=https://api.openrouteservice.org   # or http://ors:8080/ors when self-hosted
ORS_API_KEY=your-openrouteservice-api-key
ORS_PROFILE=driving-hgv
ORS_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND=2
ORS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
ORS_MAX_WAYPOINTS=50
```

> **The ORS key is deliberately configured in two places.** One vendor account serves two
> consumers, and they read the credential from two different stores (spec 11 §7.2 / §18.7):
>
> | Consumer | Store | Purpose |
> |---|---|---|
> | TripManagement | `AppSettings:Routing` (the `ORS_*` env vars above) | Directions / matrix — route planning |
> | Router | a Manager **`GeocodingProvider`** row, entered in the systemAdmin panel | Reverse geocoding of incoming positions |
>
> This duplication is intentional, not an oversight. `GeocodingProvider` has a
> **single-active-row** model that cannot express "Nominatim for addresses, ORS for routes",
> it is Router-owned, and route planning must not depend on which geocoder an operator
> happens to have activated. Nominatim remains the default reverse-geocoder; adding an ORS
> `GeocodingProvider` row is optional and independent of route planning.

#### Toll Catalog Bootstrap (empty by design)

The platform ships with **zero toll stations, zero tariffs and zero vehicle classes**. This
is a deliberate product decision, not missing seed data: there is no external toll API and no
licensed dataset behind this feature. Each deployment enters its own catalog through the
admin UI or the CSV import surface.

Until you do, toll estimation returns a **null estimate** — never a fabricated or
zero-defaulted number. Reports expose the gap explicitly through the `PartialNoTariff` column
on `trip-toll-cost`, so partial coverage is visible rather than silently netted to zero.
An empty catalog does not block trip creation, planning or execution.

##### Colombia: loading the catalog from the INVÍAS open data

`scripts/fetch-toll-catalog.mjs` turns the official INVÍAS publication
([datos.gov.co/Transporte/Peajes/68qj-5xux](https://www.datos.gov.co/Transporte/Peajes/68qj-5xux),
"Peajes registrados sobre La Red Vial Nacional", covering INVÍAS and ANI-concession
stations) into a single SQL script:

```bash
node scripts/fetch-toll-catalog.mjs --effective-from 2026-01-01 --out toll-catalog.sql
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d TrackHub -f toll-catalog.sql
```

That loads the 7 vehicle classes, ~173 stations and ~1 026 tariffs in one transaction.
The skipped records are listed in the script's header comment.

Before running it:

- **Clear any test data first.** `SELECT count(*) FROM trip.toll_stations;` should be 0.
  The trip smoke tests create real stations and vehicle classes (`SMK*`, `smoke-*`), and
  the catalog is platform-wide, so they are visible to every account.
- **The script is one transaction and is not idempotent.** Running it twice fails on the
  unique indexes and rolls back rather than duplicating — which is the behaviour you
  want, because a duplicated station is matched twice by `ST_DWithin` and charges its
  toll twice in every estimate.
- **Use the admin UI or CSV import for later rate changes, not this script.**
  `createTollTariff` closes the open tariff row and inserts a new one, so a past trip's
  estimate stays reproducible against the rate it was priced with. Re-running the SQL
  would not.

Two caveats on the data itself:

- **The source's scalar `latitud`/`longitud` columns are corrupt for a large minority of
  records** — both hold the latitude. The script reads the GeoJSON `point` instead and
  rejects anything outside Colombia's bounding box. This is not cosmetic: a mislocated
  station never matches `ST_DWithin`, so it vanishes from every estimate silently
  rather than failing.
- **Verify the figures against the resolution in force** before relying on them
  commercially. This is published reference data, not a contractual source, and tariffs
  change by resolution (INVÍAS raised them 5.10% by IPC in January 2026). Categories
  **VI and VII** are priced at 88 of the 179 stations but their descriptions are left as
  `CONFIRMAR` — the axle rules vary by concession and are not published with the dataset.

Stations with no priced category (decommissioned, `NO OPERATIVO`) are skipped rather than
loaded at zero.

### Database Server Requirements

The deployment assumes an existing PostgreSQL server. Two databases are required:

| Database | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `TrackHubSecurity` | Identity, users, roles, policies |
| `TrackHub` | Assets, transporters, devices, geofences, trips, positions |

The PostgreSQL server must be accessible from the application server(s) over the network.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Docker

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and back in, then verify
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### 2. Clone Repositories

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir -p /opt/trackhub
cd /opt/trackhub

# Clone the repository — one clone brings every service, the portal and this folder
git clone https://github.com/shernandezp/TrackHub.git /opt/trackhub

cd /opt/trackhub/TrackHub.Deployment
cp .env.example .env
```

The checkout root (`/opt/trackhub`) is the docker build context: every compose
service builds with `context: ..` and each Dockerfile copies from
`TrackHubCommon/`, `TrackHub.Manager/` and the other service directories, so those
must sit alongside `TrackHub.Deployment/`. A normal clone gives you exactly that.

`clone-repos.sh` is no longer needed for the first checkout — the clone above *is*
the checkout. Run it later to fast-forward the checkout and verify no source
directory has gone missing. It reads these settings from `.env`:

| Setting | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_OWNER` | Account that owns the repository | `shernandezp` |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | Repository name | `TrackHub` |
| `GITHUB_BRANCH` | Branch to check out (`main` or `develop`) | `main` |
| `GITHUB_USER` / `GITHUB_PASSWORD` | Credentials, private repository only | *(empty)* |

For a private deployment, point it at your own copy:

```bash
GITHUB_OWNER=your-account
GITHUB_REPO=TrackHub.Private
GITHUB_USER=your-username
GITHUB_PASSWORD=ghp_your_personal_access_token
```

> `GITHUB_REPO_SUFFIX` from the per-repository layout is no longer read. An existing
> `.env` that set `GITHUB_OWNER` plus a suffix still resolves correctly, but set
> `GITHUB_REPO` explicitly if your repository is not named `TrackHub`.

> `GITHUB_PASSWORD` must be a **Personal Access Token**, not your account password —
> GitHub no longer accepts passwords over HTTPS. Create one at
> [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the `repo` scope.
> The token is only ever passed to `git` on the command line; it is not written into
> any repository's `.git/config`.

> `TrackHubRouter` also provides the **SyncWorker** background service — it has no
> separate repository.

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
cd TrackHub.Deployment

# Copy example configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Edit configuration (see Configuration Reference section)
nano .env
```

### 4. Create the Database Schema (EF migrations)

> ⚠️ **Required on a fresh install.** `db-init` **seeds data only** — it does not create or
> alter tables (see [Database Setup](#database-setup)). Deploying against empty databases
> makes the `db-init` container fail.

Apply migrations for the **five** projects that own them (Telemetry has none — its `telemetry`
schema is created by the Manager migrations).

> ⚠️ **AuthorityServer is one of them.** Its `AuthorityDbContext` owns the four `OpenIddict*` tables
> and lives in the **Security** database. Without this step the platform cannot issue tokens.
>
> **Upgrading a deployment created before this step existed?** Its OpenIddict tables are already
> present but carry no `__EFMigrationsHistory` row, so `database update` fails with
> *relation "OpenIddictApplications" already exists*. **Baseline it instead** — insert the
> InitialCreate row so EF adopts the existing tables:
>
> ```sql
> INSERT INTO "__EFMigrationsHistory" ("MigrationId", "ProductVersion")
> SELECT '20260722030751_InitialCreate', '10.0.10'
> WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM "__EFMigrationsHistory" WHERE "MigrationId" = '20260722030751_InitialCreate');
> ```
>
> Fresh installs need none of that — just run the command below with the others.

**Prerequisites on the host running the migrations:**

```bash
# .NET SDK + EF tooling
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

# TrackHubCommon needs no separate step — the services reference it as a
# ProjectReference, so restore (and therefore `dotnet ef`) builds it from the
# source in this checkout.
```

Set the connection strings explicitly — **do not rely on the services' `appsettings.json`,
which contains a localhost dev connection string** and would otherwise be used silently:

```bash
cd /opt/trackhub

export SECURITY_CONN="server=db.example.com;port=5432;database=TrackHubSecurity;user id=trackhub;password=YourStrongPassword"
export MANAGER_CONN="server=db.example.com;port=5432;database=TrackHub;user id=trackhub;password=YourStrongPassword"

ConnectionStrings__Security="$SECURITY_CONN" dotnet ef database update \
  --project TrackHubSecurity/src/Infrastructure/SecurityDB --startup-project TrackHubSecurity/src/Web

# OpenIddict tables (applications/authorizations/scopes/tokens). Same database as Security, and it
# MUST run after the Security migration above. Skip on an existing deployment — baseline it instead
# (see the note above). --context is required: this project also carries a SecurityDbContext, whose
# migration is deliberately empty (TrackHubSecurity owns those tables; DM-05 convention).
ConnectionStrings__Security="$SECURITY_CONN" dotnet ef database update \
  --project TrackHub.AuthorityServer/src/Infrastructure --startup-project TrackHub.AuthorityServer/src/Web \
  --context AuthorityDbContext

ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="$MANAGER_CONN" dotnet ef database update \
  --project TrackHub.Manager/src/Infrastructure/ManagerDB --startup-project TrackHub.Manager/src/Web

ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="$MANAGER_CONN" dotnet ef database update \
  --project TrackHub.Geofencing/src/Infrastructure/ManagerDB --startup-project TrackHub.Geofencing/src/Web

ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="$MANAGER_CONN" dotnet ef database update \
  --project TrackHub.TripManagement/src/Infrastructure/TripDB --startup-project TrackHub.TripManagement/src/Web

cd /opt/trackhub/TrackHub.Deployment
```

Geofencing and TripManagement both require the `postgis` extension in the `TrackHub`
database (see [Database Setup](#database-setup)). TripManagement's `trip` schema lives in
the same `TrackHub` database, so it uses the same `${DB_CONNECTION_MANAGER}` connection.

### 5. Set Up Certificates

```bash
# Obtain Let's Encrypt SSL certificate + generate OpenIddict certificate
# Args: <domain> <letsencrypt-email> [certificate-password]
# Requires DOMAIN and LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL in .env (or pass as arguments)
sudo ./scripts/generate-certs.sh your-domain.com admin@your-domain.com
```

### 6. Configure OAuth Clients

```bash
# Copy and edit clients.json
cp config/clients.json.example config/clients.json
nano config/clients.json

# Update the callback URI with your domain, and set each service client's
# secret to match the matching *_CLIENT_SECRET in .env
```

### 7. Deploy

```bash
# Deploy full stack
./scripts/deploy.sh full --build
```

### 8. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check health
./scripts/health-check.sh your-domain.com

# View logs
./scripts/logs.sh
```

---

## Detailed Installation

### Step 1: Prepare the Linux Server

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install required packages
sudo apt install -y \
    curl \
    git \
    openssl \
    htop \
    ufw

# Configure firewall
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp   # SSH
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp   # HTTP
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp  # HTTPS
sudo ufw enable
```

### Step 2: Install Docker

```bash
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Add current user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Start Docker on boot
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Log out and back in
exit
# SSH back in

# Verify installation
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### Step 3: Set Up Project Structure

```bash
# Create directory structure
sudo mkdir -p /opt/trackhub
sudo chown $USER:$USER /opt/trackhub
cd /opt/trackhub

# Clone the repository (as shown in Quick Start)
```

### Step 4: Database Setup

Before deploying, ensure your PostgreSQL database is accessible:

```bash
# Test database connectivity
psql -h your-db-server.com -U postgres -d postgres -c "SELECT version();"
```

See the [Database Setup](#database-setup) section for detailed database initialization instructions.

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Create and configure the `.env` file:

```bash
cd /opt/trackhub/TrackHub.Deployment
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the file with your configuration:

```bash
nano .env
```

Key configurations to update:

```env
# Domain
DOMAIN=trackhub.example.com
ALLOWED_CORS_ORIGINS=https://trackhub.example.com

# Database  (note: the user field is "user id=" WITH a space — the scripts parse that exact key)
DB_CONNECTION_SECURITY=server=db.example.com;user id=postgres;password=SecurePass123;database=TrackHubSecurity;port=5432
DB_CONNECTION_MANAGER=server=db.example.com;user id=postgres;password=SecurePass123;database=TrackHub;port=5432
DB_CONNECTION_TELEMETRY=server=db.example.com;user id=postgres;password=SecurePass123;database=TrackHub;port=5432
DB_CONNECTION_LOGGING=server=db.example.com;user id=postgres;password=SecurePass123;database=TrackHub;port=5432

# Certificate
CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD=your-cert-password

# Encryption (generate a new GUID)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

# Service-to-service OAuth secrets — no defaults; must match config/clients.json
SYNCWORKER_CLIENT_SECRET=your-syncworker-client-secret
ROUTER_CLIENT_SECRET=your-router-client-secret
SECURITY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-security-client-secret
GEOFENCE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-geofence-client-secret
TRIP_CLIENT_SECRET=your-trip-client-secret
REPORTING_CLIENT_ID=reporting_client
REPORTING_CLIENT_SECRET=your-reporting-client-secret

# Route planning (spec 11) — REQUIRED before the trip module can be released
ORS_API_KEY=your-openrouteservice-api-key

# Update all REACT_APP_ URLs with your domain
REACT_APP_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT=https://trackhub.example.com/Identity/authorize
# ... etc
```

`DB_CONNECTION_TELEMETRY` and the four `*_CLIENT_SECRET` keys have **no defaults** in
`docker-compose.yml`. Omitting them yields a Telemetry service with an empty connection
string and four service clients that cannot authenticate.

### Step 6: SSL and OpenIddict Certificates

You need **two types of certificates**:
1. **SSL/TLS Certificate** - For HTTPS (Nginx) — obtained from Let's Encrypt
2. **OpenIddict Certificate** - For token signing (Authority Server and all APIs)

#### SSL Certificate (Let's Encrypt)

The `generate-certs.sh` script handles both certificates. Add these to your `.env`:

```env
DOMAIN=trackhub.example.com
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=admin@trackhub.example.com
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/generate-certs.sh
```

This will:
- Install `certbot` if not present
- Obtain a free Let's Encrypt certificate (valid 90 days, auto-renewed)
- Generate the OpenIddict `.pfx` certificate for token signing
- Set up a daily cron job that checks for renewal

If nginx is already running, it uses the **webroot** method (zero downtime). Otherwise, it uses **standalone** mode.

**Manual alternative (if not using the script):**

```bash
# Install certbot
sudo apt install -y certbot

# Obtain certificate
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d trackhub.example.com --email admin@trackhub.example.com --agree-tos

# Copy certificates
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/trackhub.example.com/fullchain.pem certificates/
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/trackhub.example.com/privkey.pem certificates/
sudo chown $USER:$USER certificates/*.pem
```

#### OpenIddict Certificate (for Token Signing)

All services (Authority Server, Security, Manager, etc.) use the same OpenIddict certificate to sign and validate tokens. For Linux/Docker deployments, certificates are loaded from a `.pfx` file.

```bash
# Generate OpenIddict certificate (if not using generate-certs.sh)
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
    -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
    -days 365 -nodes \
    -subj "/CN=trackhub.example.com"

# Convert to PFX format
openssl pkcs12 -export \
    -out certificates/certificate.pfx \
    -inkey key.pem -in cert.pem \
    -password pass:your-secure-password

# Clean up
rm key.pem cert.pem

# Update .env with the password
# CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

**Note:** The `generate-certs.sh` script creates both SSL and OpenIddict certificates in one step.

### Step 7: Configure OAuth Clients

```bash
cp config/clients.json.example config/clients.json
```

Edit `config/clients.json`:

```json
{
  "scopes": [
    {"name": "web_scope", "resource": "trackhub_api"},
    {"name": "mobile_scope", "resource": "trackhub_api"},

    {"clientId": "trip_client",       "clientSecret": "generate-a-secure-secret-here", "scope": "service_scope"}
  ]
}
```

> **Tenant-bound (partner) service clients:** the five clients above are **platform-internal** —
> their permission rows are seeded with `allowcrossaccount = true`, they receive a token with **no**
> `account_id` claim, and they legitimately operate across every account. A partner/TMS client is
> the opposite: seed its rows in `security.service_client_permissions` **with** an `accountid` and
> **without** `allowcrossaccount`, and the token endpoint will bind its tokens to that account
> automatically. If a partner client ends up holding grants on **several** accounts, its token
> requests must add an `account_id=<account-guid>` form parameter to pick the tenant — otherwise the
> token endpoint answers `invalid_request`, by design, rather than guessing a customer. See
> *Client Credentials Flow* in `TrackHub.AuthorityServer/README.en.md` for the full claim rules.

> **Important:** The `resource` for every scope must be `trackhub_api` (this is the

> `${GEOFENCE_CLIENT_SECRET}` / `${TRIP_CLIENT_SECRET}` values in your `.env`, and `OPENIDDICT_SCOPES` in `.env` must
> list the same scopes (`mobile_scope,driver_mobile_scope,web_scope,service_scope`).

### Step 8: Deploy

```bash
# Full stack deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh full --build

# Monitor deployment
docker compose logs -f
```

### Step 9: Initialize Databases

The database initialization container runs automatically on first deployment. Monitor its progress:

```bash
docker logs -f trackhub-db-init
```

### Step 10: Sync User and Account IDs

The User and Account IDs between the two databases are automatically synchronized during database initialization. However, if you need to run this manually (or re-run it), use the sync script:

```bash
# Run the sync script
./scripts/sync-user-account-ids.sh

# Or run without confirmation prompt
./scripts/sync-user-account-ids.sh --yes
```

**What this script does:**

1. Gets the user ID from `TrackHubSecurity.security.users`
2. Updates `TrackHub.app.users.userid` with the security user ID
3. Updates `TrackHub.app.user_settings.userid` with the security user ID
4. Gets the account ID from `TrackHub.app.accounts`
5. Updates `TrackHubSecurity.security.users.accountid` with the account ID

> The tables are **plural** (`security.users`, `app.users`, `app.accounts`). Older versions
> of this guide used singular names; those relations do not exist.

**Manual sync (if needed):**

If you prefer to sync manually via SQL — run the first two statements against the
**TrackHubSecurity** database and the rest against **TrackHub** (they are separate
databases; you cannot cross-query them in one connection):

```sql
-- In TrackHubSecurity:
SELECT id FROM security.users;
-- Example result: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

-- In TrackHub:
SELECT userid FROM app.users;
-- Example result: 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111

UPDATE app.users
SET userid = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
WHERE userid = '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111';

UPDATE app.user_settings
SET userid = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
WHERE userid = '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111';

SELECT accountid FROM app.accounts;
-- Example result: 660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

-- Back in TrackHubSecurity:
UPDATE security.users
SET accountid = '660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
WHERE id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000';
```

### Step 11: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Health check
./scripts/health-check.sh trackhub.example.com

# Test in browser
# https://trackhub.example.com
```

## Centralized Configuration Management

All backend services share similar `appsettings.json` configurations. Instead of manually updating each service's configuration file, use the centralized configuration tools.

### Configuration Workflow

1. **Edit the central `.env` file** with all your settings
2. **Run the generator** to create the `appsettings.json` files in `generated/`
3. **Deploy** — the compose files bind-mount `generated/appsettings.<service>.json` read-only
   over each container's `/app/appsettings.json`

`deploy.sh` regenerates the `generated/` files from `.env` before every backend/full
deployment, so a normal deploy already picks up your `.env` changes. Environment variables
set in the compose files still take precedence over the mounted `appsettings.json`.

### Generate AppSettings Files

```bash
# Preview all generated configurations (stdout)
./scripts/generate-appsettings.sh

# Generate all backend configs into generated/
./scripts/generate-appsettings.sh --output-dir ./generated

# Generate for a specific service only
./scripts/generate-appsettings.sh --service manager --output-dir ./generated
```

### Full Configuration Sync

The `sync-config.sh` script handles both backend and frontend configuration:

```bash
# Validate your .env configuration
./scripts/sync-config.sh validate

# Show current configuration values
./scripts/sync-config.sh show

# Generate all backend appsettings.json files into generated/
./scripts/sync-config.sh generate

# Generate only the React .env file
./scripts/sync-config.sh frontend
```

### Configuration Template

The master template at `config/appsettings.template.json` shows all configurable values and their environment variable mappings:

| Variable | Used By | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `${ALLOWED_CORS_ORIGINS}` | All services | CORS allowed origins |
| `${AUTHORITY_URL}` | All except Authority | Identity provider URL |
| `${DB_CONNECTION_SECURITY}` | Authority, Security | Security database (`TrackHubSecurity`) |
| `${DB_CONNECTION_MANAGER}` | Manager, Geofencing, TripManagement | Manager database (`TrackHub`) |
| `${DB_CONNECTION_TELEMETRY}` | Telemetry | Telemetry DB — **must be the same `TrackHub` database** (schema `telemetry`) |
| `${DB_CONNECTION_LOGGING}` | All backend services | Centralized logging database |
| `${CERTIFICATE_PATH}` | All services | Path to OpenIddict certificate |
| `${CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD}` | All services | Certificate password |
| `${ENCRYPTION_KEY}` | Security, Manager, Router, SyncWorker | Database encryption key |
| `${SECURITY_CLIENT_ID}` / `${SECURITY_CLIENT_SECRET}` | Security | `security_client` service credentials (audit forwarding) |
| `${ROUTER_CLIENT_ID}` / `${ROUTER_CLIENT_SECRET}` | Router | `router_client` service credentials |
| `${SYNCWORKER_CLIENT_ID}` / `${SYNCWORKER_CLIENT_SECRET}` | SyncWorker | `syncworker_client` service credentials |
| `${GEOFENCE_CLIENT_ID}` / `${GEOFENCE_CLIENT_SECRET}` | Geofencing | `geofence_client` service credentials (alert emission + dwell-evaluator job runs toward Manager) |
| `${TRIP_CLIENT_ID}` / `${TRIP_CLIENT_SECRET}` | TripManagement | `trip_client` service credentials (alerts, job runs, public links, driver/transporter validation toward Manager; position history toward Telemetry) |
| `${REPORTING_CLIENT_ID}` / `${REPORTING_CLIENT_SECRET}` | Reporting | `reporting_client` service credentials — reads the account's time zone from Manager so report day boundaries are the account's. Without them every preview and export fails at start-up with `Setting 'ClientId' not found` |
| `${ROUTING_PROVIDER}` / `${ORS_BASE_URL}` / `${ORS_API_KEY}` / `${ORS_PROFILE}` / `${ORS_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND}` / `${ORS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS}` / `${ORS_MAX_WAYPOINTS}` | TripManagement | `AppSettings:Routing` — OpenRouteService directions/matrix. **Required per deployment**, see [OpenRouteService provisioning](#openrouteservice-provisioning-required) |
| `${ORS_INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS}` / `${ORS_BACKGROUND_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW}` / `${ORS_BACKGROUND_WINDOW_SECONDS}` | TripManagement | `AppSettings:Routing` admission control — how long an interactive caller waits for a slot (default 15s) and the background ETA-refresh budget per rolling window (defaults 250 per 300s) |
| `${DOCUMENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER}` / `${DOCUMENT_STORAGE_LOCAL_ROOT}` / `${DOCUMENT_RETENTION_DAYS}` | Manager | Document management storage |
| `${SMTP_*}` / `${WHATSAPP_*}` / `${PORTAL_BASE_URL}` / `${NOTIFICATION_DELIVERY_RETENTION_DAYS}` / `${NOTIFICATION_SENDING_RECLAIM_MINUTES}` | Manager | Alerts & notifications delivery channels, retention, and stuck-delivery reclaim (default 10 min) |
| `${BACKGROUND_JOB_RUN_RETENTION_DAYS}` / `${ALERT_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS}` | Manager | Platform retention sweep (`platform-retention` job) — job-run history and alert events purge windows (defaults 90 / 180 days) |
| `${GRAPHQL_*_SERVICE}` | Various | Internal service URLs (includes `GRAPHQL_TELEMETRY_SERVICE` and `GRAPHQL_TRIP_SERVICE`) |
| `${REPORTING_MAX_EXPORT_ROWS}` / `${REPORTING_MAX_PDF_ROWS}` / `${REPORTING_PREVIEW_ROWS}` | Reporting | `AppSettings:Reporting` — report export/preview row limits. Defaults 100000 / 500 / 100 come from `ReportingLimitsOptions`; set these in `.env` and compose passes them as `AppSettings__Reporting__*` (`generate-appsettings.sh` writes the same block into `appsettings.reporting.json`) — no rebuild needed. |

### When to Regenerate

Regenerate appsettings when you change:
- Domain or URLs
- Database connection strings
- Encryption keys
- Certificate paths or passwords
- Service endpoint URLs

### Document Storage: S3 / Azure Blob

`LocalFileSystem` (the default) needs none of the keys below — documents persist to the
`manager-documents` volume. If you set `DOCUMENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=S3` or `AzureBlob`, the
**required** keys become mandatory: the Manager throws at startup without them.

| Variable | Required? | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `DOCUMENT_S3_BUCKET_NAME` | **Required for S3** | Target bucket |
| `DOCUMENT_S3_REGION` | Optional | AWS region (e.g. `us-east-1`) |
| `DOCUMENT_S3_SERVICE_URL` | Optional | Custom endpoint (MinIO / S3-compatible) |
| `DOCUMENT_S3_ACCESS_KEY` | Optional | Static key; omit both keys to use the default AWS credential chain (IAM role) |
| `DOCUMENT_S3_SECRET_KEY` | Optional | Static secret |
| `DOCUMENT_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` | Optional | Defaults to true when a custom `SERVICE_URL` is set |
| `DOCUMENT_S3_PRESIGNED_EXPIRY_MINUTES` | Optional | Presigned-URL TTL (default `5`) |
| `DOCUMENT_AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME` | **Required for AzureBlob** | Blob container |
| `DOCUMENT_AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING` | **Required for AzureBlob** | Storage account connection string |
| `DOCUMENT_AZURE_SAS_EXPIRY_MINUTES` | Optional | SAS TTL (default `5`) |

Switching provider does **not** migrate existing documents — move the contents of the
`manager-documents` volume to the new backend yourself.

### Service Ports (Internal)

| Service | Internal Port |
|---------|---------------|
| Authority | 8080 |
| Security | 8080 |
| Manager | 8080 |
| Router | 8080 |
| Geofencing | 8080 |
| TripManagement | 8080 |
| Telemetry | 8080 |
| Reporting | 8080 |
| SyncWorker | - (background) |

### URL Paths

| Path | Service | Authentication |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `/` | Frontend (React) | Static files — the SPA itself is never authenticated |
| `/status` | Frontend (React) | **Anonymous.** Platform status page — see below |
| `/health` | nginx | Anonymous (static 200) |
| `/health/{service}` | Per-service passthrough | Anonymous |
| `/Identity/*` | Authority Server | Anonymous (it *is* the sign-in surface) |
| `/Security/*` | Security API | Bearer token |
| `/Manager/*` | Manager API | Bearer token, **except** `/Manager/api/PlatformStatus/announcements` |
| `/Router/*` | Router API | Bearer token |
| `/Geofence/*` | Geofencing API | Bearer token |
| `/Trip/*` | Trip Management API | Bearer token, **except** the anonymous public-link resolution surface |
| `/Telemetry/*` | Telemetry API | Bearer token |
| `/Reporting/*` | Reporting API | Bearer token |

**Deliberately anonymous surfaces.** `/status`, the `/health*` probes, and
`GET /Manager/api/PlatformStatus/announcements` are unauthenticated **by design**: the status page
must answer "is the platform down?" for a user who cannot sign in, which rules out anything behind
the login. The announcements endpoint is rate-limited per client IP, output-cached for 60 s, and
returns only currently-visible announcements — it never exposes drafts, scheduling metadata, or any
account data. Do not put these behind auth or an IP allowlist without removing the status page too.

---

## Build Architecture

### Docker Build Context

All services use the parent directory (`/opt/trackhub/`) as the Docker build context. This allows each Dockerfile to access:

1. **Its own source directory** (e.g., `TrackHub.Manager/`)
2. **The TrackHubCommon source** (`TrackHubCommon/`), consumed as a `ProjectReference` —
   the Dockerfile copies it in the repository layout and restore/build resolve it from source
3. **Shared scripts** (`TrackHub.Deployment/scripts/`)

Each Dockerfile has a matching `docker/<Dockerfile>.dockerignore` file that
excludes host build artifacts (`bin/`, `obj/`, `node_modules/`, `build/`, `.git/`)
from the context. This is required for correctness, not just speed: without it,
host-generated `obj/`/`bin/` folders would be copied into the image and overwrite
the container's own restore/compile output, causing `dotnet publish --no-restore`
to treat the code as up-to-date and ship **stale binaries**. Keeping these out of
the context also lets Docker's layer cache detect real source changes, so normal
cached builds always deploy updated code and `--no-cache` is not required.

### Deterministic Updates (No Stale Artifacts)

Updates are designed to always deploy current code without `--no-cache`, repeated
runs, or manual cleanup:

- **Backend / worker images** use ordered layers (`.csproj` → `restore` →
  `COPY src` → `publish`). Because `bin/`/`obj/` are ignored, a source change
  invalidates the `COPY src` layer and forces a real recompile; unchanged code
  reuses the cache safely.
- **Frontend** builds are baked into the image at `/app/dist`. The container
  entrypoint (`docker/frontend-entrypoint.sh`) copies that build into the shared
  `trackhub-frontend` volume on **every start**, and nginx only starts once the
  frontend reports healthy. This fixes the classic named-volume trap where Docker
  populates a volume only when it is first created (empty), leaving nginx serving
  the previous build after a rebuild.
- **`--force-recreate`** guarantees containers are replaced by the freshly built
  images on every deploy.

### TrackHubCommon (shared library)

TrackHub services depend on the **TrackHubCommon** shared library, which is not published to nuget.org. It is consumed as a `ProjectReference`: each Dockerfile copies the `TrackHubCommon/` sources into the image build context in the same layout as the repository, and `dotnet restore`/`build` resolve the `Common.*` projects directly from source. There is no packing stage and no local NuGet feed.

Because the library is compiled from the `TrackHubCommon/` source on every image build, updating it requires nothing beyond rebuilding the affected services — and there are no per-service version pins to keep in lockstep; the `<Version>` on TrackHubCommon only stamps the assemblies and any packages `dotnet pack` produces.

### Reverse Proxy and HTTPS

Nginx terminates SSL and forwards HTTP requests to backend containers. Each ASP.NET service uses `ForwardedHeaders` middleware to trust `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-For` headers from nginx, ensuring the application correctly identifies requests as HTTPS even though internal traffic is HTTP.

---

## Deployment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Server (Full Stack)

Use `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh full --build
```

The deployment script rebuilds images using the Docker layer cache (source
changes are detected automatically), then starts services with
`--force-recreate --no-build` so the running containers come from the freshly
built images. Add `--no-cache` only if you ever need to force a full rebuild.

### Scenario 2: Separate Frontend and Backend

#### Backend Server

```bash
# Copy .env.backend.example to .env
cp .env.backend.example .env
# Edit with backend-specific settings
nano .env

# Deploy backend only
./scripts/deploy.sh backend --build
```

#### Frontend Server

```bash
# Copy .env.frontend.example to .env
cp .env.frontend.example .env
# Edit with frontend-specific settings (pointing to backend server)
nano .env

# Deploy frontend only
./scripts/deploy.sh frontend --build
```

---

## Database Setup

### PostgreSQL Requirements

- PostgreSQL 14+
- Two databases: `TrackHubSecurity` and `TrackHub`
- The **`postgis`** extension in the `TrackHub` database (required by Geofencing and by
  TripManagement — their migrations declare `HasPostgresExtension("postgis")`). One
  `CREATE EXTENSION` covers both; they share the database.
- Must be installed and operational before deploying TrackHub

### The Schema Is Created by EF Migrations — Not by `db-init`

This trips people up, so it is worth stating plainly:

| Step | What it does | What it does **not** do |
|------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **EF migrations** (`dotnet ef database update`) | Create and alter all tables/schemas | — |
| **`db-init`** (runs inside `deploy.sh full`) | Seed reference data + OAuth clients (idempotent) | **Does not create or alter any table** |

Both `DBInitializer`s call `SeedAsync()` only. Running `db-init` against an empty database
fails. Apply migrations **first**, on a fresh install *and* on every upgrade that adds them.

### Manual Database Creation

Run as a **superuser** — `CREATE EXTENSION` requires it:

```sql
-- Create databases
CREATE DATABASE "TrackHubSecurity";
CREATE DATABASE "TrackHub";

-- Create user (if needed)
CREATE USER trackhub WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "TrackHubSecurity" TO trackhub;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "TrackHub" TO trackhub;

-- PostgreSQL 15+: database-level grants do NOT allow creating objects. The role also needs
-- the public schema, where Serilog auto-creates its "logs" table (needAutoCreateTable).
\c TrackHubSecurity
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO trackhub;

\c TrackHub
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO trackhub;

-- PostGIS, in the TrackHub database (superuser required)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;
```

### Applying Migrations

Four services own migrations. **Telemetry has none** — its `telemetry` schema is created by
the Manager migrations.

| Service | Migrations project | Startup project | Target DB |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Security | `TrackHubSecurity/src/Infrastructure/SecurityDB` | `TrackHubSecurity/src/Web` | `TrackHubSecurity` |
| Manager | `TrackHub.Manager/src/Infrastructure/ManagerDB` | `TrackHub.Manager/src/Web` | `TrackHub` |
| Geofencing | `TrackHub.Geofencing/src/Infrastructure/ManagerDB` | `TrackHub.Geofencing/src/Web` | `TrackHub` |
| TripManagement | `TrackHub.TripManagement/src/Infrastructure/TripDB` | `TrackHub.TripManagement/src/Web` | `TrackHub` (schema `trip`, **requires `postgis`**) |

Set the connection strings explicitly — the services'
`appsettings.json` holds a **localhost dev** connection string that EF would otherwise use
silently. (`TrackHubCommon` builds from source automatically — it is a `ProjectReference`,
so no local feed setup is needed.)

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

cd /opt/trackhub

export SECURITY_CONN="server=db.example.com;port=5432;database=TrackHubSecurity;user id=trackhub;password=YourStrongPassword"
export MANAGER_CONN="server=db.example.com;port=5432;database=TrackHub;user id=trackhub;password=YourStrongPassword"

ConnectionStrings__Security="$SECURITY_CONN" dotnet ef database update \
  --project TrackHubSecurity/src/Infrastructure/SecurityDB --startup-project TrackHubSecurity/src/Web

ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="$MANAGER_CONN" dotnet ef database update \
  --project TrackHub.Manager/src/Infrastructure/ManagerDB --startup-project TrackHub.Manager/src/Web

ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="$MANAGER_CONN" dotnet ef database update \
  --project TrackHub.Geofencing/src/Infrastructure/ManagerDB --startup-project TrackHub.Geofencing/src/Web

ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="$MANAGER_CONN" dotnet ef database update \
  --project TrackHub.TripManagement/src/Infrastructure/TripDB --startup-project TrackHub.TripManagement/src/Web
```

> **Existing deployments: re-run `db-init` after adding TripManagement.** The trip
> authorization surface depends on seeded data — the `trip_client` service-client
> registration and its permissions, and the `Trips` / `TripTracking` / `TollCatalog`
> resources plus their role matrix. Migrations alone do **not** seed any of it. Until
> `db-init` has run again, **every trip call returns `FORBIDDEN`**, including for
> administrators, and the service itself looks healthy. See
> [Upgrading From a Previous Version](#upgrading-from-a-previous-version).

### Running Seeders Manually

These **seed only** — they assume the schema already exists (see above).

```bash
# Build and run ClientSeeder
cd /opt/trackhub/TrackHub.AuthorityServer/src/ClientSeeder
dotnet build
dotnet run

# Build and run Security DBInitializer
cd /opt/trackhub/TrackHubSecurity/src/DBInitializer
dotnet build
dotnet run

# Build and run Manager DBInitializer
cd /opt/trackhub/TrackHub.Manager/src/DBInitializer
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## Migrating to a New Server (Existing Database)

If you already have a running TrackHub installation and want to migrate the application services to a new server while keeping your existing database, follow these steps:

### What the db-init Container Does

The `db-init` container runs on **every deploy** and performs:

1. **ClientSeeder** - Upserts the OAuth scopes and clients from `config/clients.json` (idempotent)
2. **Security DBInitializer** - Seeds security resources, roles, and service-client registrations (idempotent)
3. **Manager DBInitializer** - Seeds master data (report catalog, transporter types, master account/user) (idempotent)
4. **Sync User/Account IDs** - One-time foreign-key alignment between the two databases, guarded by a flag file (`db-init-flag` volume)

Steps 1–3 are idempotent: they upsert or skip anything that already exists, so re-running adds any clients/resources present in `config/clients.json` and the seed data while leaving existing rows untouched. Only step 4 is gated by the flag file.

> **Schema vs. seed:** the DBInitializers **seed data only** — they assume the database
> schema already exists. EF Core **schema migrations ("DB updates") are applied separately**
> from `db-init` (see README → *Database Migrations*, applied with your EF migration
> process, e.g. `dotnet ef database update`). Apply migrations for **all** stateful
> services — Security, Manager, **Geofencing** (`geofencing` schema), **TripManagement**
> (`trip` schema) and the `telemetry` schema (owned by Manager migrations) — before or
> alongside a deploy.

Steps 1–3 are safe to re-run, but **step 4 is a one-time destructive ID sync gated by a
flag file that lives in a volume**. When you move to a *new* server the flag volume starts
empty, so step 4 would run again against your already-synced data. Use one of the options
below to skip it.

### Option 1: Use --skip-init Flag (Recommended)

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh full --build --skip-init
```

This preserves the normal cached build and forced recreation behavior while skipping database initialization.

### Option 2: Deploy Without db-init Manually

Start all services except db-init:

```bash
# Configure your .env with existing database connection strings
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Set DB_CONNECTION_SECURITY and DB_CONNECTION_MANAGER

# Build images (cached; source changes are detected automatically) and deploy without db-init
docker compose build
docker compose up -d --force-recreate --no-build --no-deps nginx frontend authority security manager router geofencing tripmanagement telemetry reporting syncworker
```

### Option 3: Pre-create the Initialization Flag

If you want to use the normal deployment process but skip initialization:

The volume is **prefixed with the Compose project name** (derived from the deployment
directory), so do not guess it — create the stack's volumes first, then look the name up:

```bash
# Create the volumes without starting anything, then find the real flag volume name
docker compose create
docker volume ls | grep db-init-flag        # e.g. trackhubdeployment_db-init-flag

# Mark initialization as already done
docker run --rm -v <that-volume-name>:/flags alpine touch /flags/db-initialized

# Now deploy normally - db-init will detect the flag and skip
./scripts/deploy.sh full --build
```

> Creating a volume named `deployment_db-init-flag` by hand does **not** work — Compose
> mounts a differently-prefixed volume, so db-init would still run the one-time ID sync.

### Option 4: Comment Out db-init in docker-compose.yml

Edit `docker-compose.yml` and comment out the db-init service (note the build context is
the **workspace root**, one level above the deployment folder):

```yaml
# db-init:
#   build:
#     context: ..
#     dockerfile: TrackHub.Deployment/docker/Dockerfile.db-init
#   ...
```

Then remove the dependency from the authority service.

### Migration Checklist

- [ ] Backup existing database before migration
- [ ] Verify PostgreSQL is accessible from new server
- [ ] Copy SSL certificates (`certificates/` folder)
- [ ] Copy OpenIddict certificate (`certificate.pfx`)
- [ ] Update `.env` with correct database connection strings
- [ ] Update `.env` with new server's domain (if changed)
- [ ] Choose one of the skip options above
- [ ] Deploy and verify services connect properly
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Test API endpoints

---

## SSL Certificates

### Production (Let's Encrypt)

The recommended way is to use the provided script:

```bash
# Set in .env
# DOMAIN=your-domain.com
# LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=admin@your-domain.com

# Run the script (handles everything)
sudo ./scripts/generate-certs.sh
```

The script will:
1. Install `certbot` if needed
2. Obtain a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
3. Copy `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` to `certificates/`
4. Generate the OpenIddict `certificate.pfx` for token signing
5. Add a daily cron job for automatic renewal

Certificates are valid for 90 days and renew automatically. The renewal script uses the **webroot** method so nginx stays online during renewal.

```bash
# Manual renewal check
./scripts/renew-ssl.sh

# Verify renewal cron is set up
crontab -l | grep renew-ssl
```

### OpenIddict Certificate (Token Signing)

All services (including the Authority Server) use the `LoadCertFromFile` option to load the OpenIddict certificate from a `.pfx` file. This is the recommended approach for Linux/Docker deployments.

#### Option A: Generate Self-Signed Certificate (Development/Testing)

> Do **not** use `scripts/generate-certs.sh` for this. That script always obtains a real
> Let's Encrypt certificate first (it installs certbot, runs `certonly`, and exits with an
> error if `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>` never appears). It requires a public domain and
> is a production-only path. For a self-signed token-signing certificate, use OpenSSL
> directly:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
    -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem \
    -days 365 -nodes \
    -subj "/CN=your-domain.com"

# Convert to PFX format
openssl pkcs12 -export \
    -out certificates/certificate.pfx \
    -inkey key.pem -in cert.pem \
    -password pass:your-certificate-password

# Clean up temporary files
rm key.pem cert.pem
```

#### Option B: Use CA-Signed Certificate (Production)

1. Obtain a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority
2. Convert to PFX format if needed:

```bash
# If you have separate cert and key files
openssl pkcs12 -export \
    -out certificates/certificate.pfx \
    -inkey your-private-key.pem \
    -in your-certificate.pem \
    -certfile your-ca-bundle.pem \
    -password pass:your-certificate-password
```

#### Certificate Configuration

The Docker deployment is configured to use file-based certificate loading:

| Environment Variable | Description | Example |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| `OpenIddict__LoadCertFromFile` | Enable file-based loading | `true` |
| `OpenIddict__Path` | Path to certificate file | `/app/certificates/certificate.pfx` |
| `OpenIddict__Password` | Certificate password | Set in `.env` as `CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` |

**Important Notes:**
- All services use the same certificate for token validation
- The certificate is mounted as a read-only volume at `/app/certificates/`
- Set `CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file
- For production, use a CA-signed certificate with a strong password

#### Windows vs Linux Certificate Loading

| Platform | Method | Configuration |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Linux/Docker** | File-based (PFX) | `LoadCertFromFile=true`, `Path=/app/certificates/certificate.pfx` |
| **Windows (IIS)** | Certificate Store | `LoadCertFromFile=false`, `Thumbprint=<cert-thumbprint>` |

The services support both methods. For Docker deployments, file-based loading is used automatically.

## Upgrading From a Previous Version

A version upgrade can introduce new services, new configuration keys, new OAuth
clients, and new database migrations. Because `.env` and `config/clients.json`
are **your local files** (they are not overwritten by `git pull`), you must merge the
new keys into them yourself. Follow these steps in order.

### 1. Back up first

```bash
cd /opt/trackhub/TrackHub.Deployment
./scripts/backup-database.sh backup          # dumps BOTH databases into one archive
cp .env .env.bak
cp config/clients.json config/clients.json.bak

# Uploaded documents are NOT in the database — back the volume up too
docker volume ls | grep manager-documents
docker run --rm -v <volume-name>:/data -v "$PWD/backups:/backup" alpine \
  tar czf /backup/documents-preupgrade.tar.gz -C /data .
```

### 2. Pull the new code

Everything ships in one repository, so a single pull brings every service —
including `TrackHub.Telemetry/` and `TrackHubCommon/`, which older instances had to
clone separately:

```bash
cd /opt/trackhub && git pull
```

**TrackHubCommon must be present on disk** — the services consume it as a
`ProjectReference`, so the backend images build it straight from its source. It is
part of this repository, so the pull above is all it takes; `deploy.sh` now reports a
missing directory as a broken checkout rather than trying to clone it.

No separate checkout is needed for **SyncWorker** — it builds from `TrackHubRouter/`.

> Upgrading an instance that predates the single-repository layout? Its `/opt/trackhub`
> holds one clone per service. Re-clone into a fresh directory
> (`git clone https://github.com/shernandezp/TrackHub.git /opt/trackhub-new`), copy your
> `TrackHub.Deployment/.env`, `certificates/` and `generated/` across, then switch over.
> Do not try to convert the old layout in place.

### 3. Reconcile your `.env` with the template

Compare your live `.env` against the updated example and add anything missing:

```bash
# Show keys present in the template but not in your .env
comm -23 <(grep -oE '^[A-Z0-9_]+=' .env.example | sort -u) \
         <(grep -oE '^[A-Z0-9_]+=' .env | sort -u)
```

Keys that are **new or changed** and required by this release:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `ROUTER_CLIENT_ID` / `ROUTER_CLIENT_SECRET` | **Add.** Router now performs service-to-service calls; must match the `router_client` in `clients.json`. |
| `SECURITY_CLIENT_ID` / `SECURITY_CLIENT_SECRET` | **Add.** Security now forwards audit/user writes; must match `security_client`. |
| `DB_CONNECTION_TELEMETRY` | **Add** (same `TrackHub` database as `DB_CONNECTION_MANAGER`). |
| `GRAPHQL_TELEMETRY_SERVICE` | **Add** (`http://telemetry:8080/graphql/`). |
| `REACT_APP_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` | **Add** (`https://<domain>/Telemetry/graphql`). |
| `DOCUMENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER` / `DOCUMENT_STORAGE_LOCAL_ROOT` / `DOCUMENT_RETENTION_DAYS` | **Add** (defaults work; documents persist to the `manager-documents` volume). |
| `OPENIDDICT_SCOPES` | **Change** to `mobile_scope,driver_mobile_scope,web_scope,service_scope`. |
| `SYNCWORKER_CLIENT_ID` | **Change** to `syncworker_client`. |
| `GEOFENCE_CLIENT_ID` / `GEOFENCE_CLIENT_SECRET` | **Add**. Geofencing now emits alert events and job runs to Manager; must match the `geofence_client` in `clients.json`. |
| `TRIP_CLIENT_ID` / `TRIP_CLIENT_SECRET` | **Add**. TripManagement calls Manager (alerts, job runs, public links, driver/transporter validation) and Telemetry; must match the `trip_client` in `clients.json`. |
| `REPORTING_CLIENT_ID` / `REPORTING_CLIENT_SECRET` | **Add**. Reporting reads the account's time zone from Manager; must match the `reporting_client` in `clients.json`. Reports fail with HTTP 500 without them. |
| `GRAPHQL_TRIP_SERVICE` | **Add** (`http://tripmanagement:8080/graphql/`). Consumed by Router (`processTripPositions`) and Reporting (trip report data). |
| `REACT_APP_TRIPMANAGEMENT_ENDPOINT` | **Add** (`https://<domain>/Trip/graphql`). Baked in at frontend build time. |
| `ROUTING_PROVIDER` / `ORS_BASE_URL` / `ORS_API_KEY` / `ORS_PROFILE` / `ORS_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND` / `ORS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` / `ORS_MAX_WAYPOINTS` | **Add.** Required before releasing the trip module — see [OpenRouteService Provisioning](#openrouteservice-provisioning-required). |

### 4. Reconcile `config/clients.json`

Bring your `clients.json` in line with `config/clients.json.example`:

- **scopes:** add `driver_mobile_scope` and `service_scope` (`resource: trackhub_api`); remove any `sec_scope`.
- **PKCEClients:** add `mobile_client` and `driver_mobile_client` if you run the mobile/driver apps.
- **serviceClients:** add `router_client`, `security_client`, `geofence_client`, and `trip_client`, and give **every** service client `"scope": "service_scope"`. Each `clientSecret` must equal the matching `*_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`.
- **`web_client.postLogoutUri`:** change to `https://<domain>/` (was `.../authentication/callback`). Logout from the portal lands on a 404 otherwise.

> After changing `clients.json` you must **re-run `db-init`** — it is what registers the
> clients and seeds the resource/role matrix. Skipping it leaves `trip_client` unregistered
> and every trip call answering `FORBIDDEN`.

### 5. Apply database migrations

`db-init` seeds data only — it does **not** create or alter the schema. Apply the EF
Core migrations for every stateful service against your existing databases **before**
starting the new images (Security → `TrackHubSecurity`; Manager, Geofencing and
TripManagement → `TrackHub`; the `telemetry` schema is created by the Manager migrations). Use your
standard migration process (e.g. `dotnet ef database update` per service, or an EF
migration bundle). This step is required on every upgrade that adds migrations.

**Migrations added by recent releases** (apply in order; each is additive and safe to re-run):

| Migration | Service | Adds | If not applied |
|-----------|---------|------|----------------|
| `AddWorkforceQualificationsAndAssignments` | Manager | `app.driver_qualifications` and `app.driver_transporter_assignments` (workforce qualifications and driver/transporter assignment history). | Every workforce call fails; qualification expiration scanning and the workforce reports return errors. |
| `InitialCreate` (TripDB) | TripManagement | The `trip` schema: trips, stops, route plans, tracking events, PODs, public-link grants, the toll catalog, plus two views. **Requires the `postgis` extension** in `TrackHub` — already present if Geofencing is deployed, since they share the database. | TripManagement crash-loops at startup; every `/Trip/*` call fails. |
| `AddTripDetectionState` (TripDB) | TripManagement | `trip.trips.consecutiveoutsidefixes` and `trip.trip_stops.outsidesinceat` — the persisted arrival/departure detection state. | Trip tracking ingestion fails; automatic stop arrival/departure detection never advances. |
| `AddPublicShareDisclosureAndTollIntegrity` (TripDB) | TripManagement | `trip.trip_stops.city` and `trip.trip_shares.includeroute` (public-share disclosure control), plus the toll-catalog integrity constraints: unique `toll_vehicle_classes.code`, the reworked `transporter_toll_classes` uniqueness/XOR check, and the `toll_tariffs` / `transporter_toll_classes` foreign keys to the vehicle-class code. | Public share links ignore the route/city disclosure settings; the toll catalog accepts duplicate and orphaned class rows. |
| `AddTollStationNameUniqueness` (TripDB) | TripManagement | Replaces the `(name, code)` unique index on `trip.toll_stations` with two partial indexes — one for coded stations, one for code-less ones. `code` is nullable and PostgreSQL treats NULLs as distinct, so the original index allowed unlimited duplicate code-less stations. | An operator can enter the same code-less station twice; route matching then finds both and charges its toll twice in every estimate. |
| `AddZeroTouchLifecycle` (TripDB) | TripManagement | Origin geofence / arming columns on `trip.trips` and the `origingeom` GiST index. | Zero-touch trip start never arms; trips stay Planned until started by hand. |

**No EF tooling on the server?** Generate the schema as plain SQL on a workstation and run it in
pgAdmin as the application role. `dotnet ef migrations script 0 <last-applied-migration>` (per
service) reproduces what production has, `dotnet ef migrations script` (no range) the full model;
diffing the two `information_schema` dumps gives the exact catch-up. Keep the resulting file with
your other operator scripts so the next upgrade starts from a known state.
| `AddServiceClientPermissionAllowCrossAccount` | Security | `security.service_client_permissions.allowcrossaccount`, and back-fills it to `TRUE` for every account-less (`accountid IS NULL`) permission row. | **Every Security permission read fails** — the column is mapped by EF, so the query errors out. Service-to-service authorization breaks platform-wide, not just for the trip module. |

> **`db-init` must be re-run after this migration, on existing deployments too.** The
> migration creates the `trip` schema but seeds nothing. The `trip_client` service-client
> registration, its permissions, and the `Trips` / `TripTracking` / `TollCatalog` resources
> and role matrix all come from the seeders. Until `db-init` runs again, **every trip call
> returns `FORBIDDEN`** — for administrators as well — while the container reports healthy
> and the schema looks complete. This is the single most likely trip-module deployment
> failure.

> **`AddServiceClientPermissionAllowCrossAccount` is the one migration you cannot skip.**
> Apply it to `TrackHubSecurity` **before** starting the new images. The new Security code
> maps `security.service_client_permissions.allowcrossaccount`; against a database that
> lacks the column **every permission read throws**, so *all* service-to-service
> authorization fails — Router, Reporting, Geofencing and TripManagement alike — and the
> containers still report healthy. This is not scoped to the trip module.

> **This matters on the code-only paths.** `update-service.sh` and the zero-downtime
> procedure do **not** run migrations. Deploying a Security image that expects
> `security.service_client_permissions.allowcrossaccount`, or a Manager image that expects
> the workforce tables, onto a database without them fails at request time until you run the
> migration. Verify afterwards with `./scripts/health-check.sh <domain>`.

### 6. Rebuild and deploy

```bash
cd /opt/trackhub/TrackHub.Deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh full --build
```

`deploy.sh full` runs `db-init`, which re-seeds idempotently — registering the new
`router_client`/`security_client` and any new scopes/permissions — and force-recreates
every container (so the Authority picks up the new `OPENIDDICT_SCOPES`). The one-time
User/Account ID sync is skipped because its flag already exists.

Images build **one at a time** (`COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=1`, set by the script): the parallel
build is OOM-killed on a 4 GB host. Expect well over an hour for a full rebuild; already-built
images are cached, so a re-run after a failure resumes where it stopped. Set
`DEPLOY_BUILD_PARALLEL=4` on a large host to speed it up.

### 7. Verify

```bash
./scripts/health-check.sh your-domain.com
```

Open `https://your-domain.com/status` and check the **Portal build** line: it is the only
surface that proves which frontend build the browser actually loaded. If the upgrade has to
be reversed, see [Version Management & Rollback](#version-management--rollback) — every
image this deploy replaced was preserved as `:previous`.

> **Note:** the per-service and [zero-downtime](#zero-downtime-updates) update paths below
> do **not** run `db-init` and do **not** apply migrations. Use them for code-only updates.
> Any upgrade that adds a migration, a new OAuth client, or a new scope must go through the
> full `deploy.sh full --build` at least once (after steps 3–5).

---

## Updating Services

For code-only updates (no new migrations, clients, or config keys), updates are
deterministic. `deploy.sh` and `update-service.sh` rebuild images with the Docker
layer cache (source changes are detected automatically) and always force-recreate
containers, and the frontend refreshes its static assets on every start. You do
**not** need `--no-cache`, repeated executions, or manual volume/repo cleanup. Pass
`--no-cache` only to force a full rebuild in exceptional cases.

Every image an update overwrites is preserved as `:previous` first, so any of these paths
can be reversed with a single command — see
[Version Management & Rollback](#version-management--rollback).

### Update Single Service

```bash
# Update only the manager service
./scripts/update-service.sh manager

# Update only the frontend
./scripts/update-service.sh frontend

# Force a full rebuild of a service (rarely needed)
./scripts/update-service.sh manager docker-compose.yml --no-cache
```

### Update All Services

```bash
# Pull the latest code — one repository, so one pull covers every service,
# the portal and this deployment folder.
cd /opt/trackhub && git pull

# Rebuild and deploy (cached, deterministic)
cd /opt/trackhub/TrackHub.Deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh full --build
```

`./scripts/clone-repos.sh` does the same pull and additionally verifies that no
source directory is missing from the checkout.

### Zero-Downtime Updates

> **Announce the window first.** Publish a maintenance announcement from the portal
> (**Platform Status → Manage announcements**, SuperAdministrator only) *before* you start.
> Announcements are stored by the Manager service and served by it, so once Manager restarts the
> banner cannot be loaded — a notice scheduled in advance is what users actually see during the
> window. Give it a `Starts at` / `Ends at` covering the window and it retires itself.
>
> Note the same dependency during the update: while Manager is restarting, the banner disappears
> from `/status` and from the portal shell. That is expected degradation, not a fault — the service
> tiles keep working because they are probed directly.

For production environments, update services one at a time:

```bash
# Update backend services
./scripts/update-service.sh authority
./scripts/update-service.sh security
./scripts/update-service.sh manager
./scripts/update-service.sh router
./scripts/update-service.sh geofencing
./scripts/update-service.sh tripmanagement   # alias: ./scripts/update-service.sh trip
./scripts/update-service.sh telemetry
./scripts/update-service.sh reporting
./scripts/update-service.sh syncworker

# Update frontend last
./scripts/update-service.sh frontend
./scripts/update-service.sh nginx
```

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### View Logs

```bash
# All services
./scripts/logs.sh

# Specific service
./scripts/logs.sh manager

# Last 50 lines, no follow
./scripts/logs.sh security -n 50 --no-follow
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check all services
./scripts/health-check.sh your-domain.com

# HTTP endpoints (nginx static probe + one anonymous passthrough per service)
curl -k https://your-domain.com/health
curl -k https://your-domain.com/health/authority
curl -k https://your-domain.com/health/security
curl -k https://your-domain.com/health/manager
curl -k https://your-domain.com/health/router
curl -k https://your-domain.com/health/geofencing
curl -k https://your-domain.com/health/trip
curl -k https://your-domain.com/health/telemetry
curl -k https://your-domain.com/health/reporting
```

Manager, Telemetry, Security, Geofencing, TripManagement and AuthorityServer health checks include a database
probe; Reporting and Router are liveness-only. The SyncWorker has no HTTP listener — its liveness is
derived from the rows it writes, and it is surfaced on the platform status page rather than here.

Non-technical users can check the same signals without a shell — and without signing in — at
`https://your-domain.com/status`.

### Backup Configuration

```bash
# Create backup
./scripts/backup.sh

# Backups are stored in deployment/backups/
```

### Database Backup & Restore

`backup` takes **no database argument** — it dumps *both* databases into a single
timestamped `.tar.gz` under `backups/database/`, and `restore` takes that tarball.

```bash
# Back up BOTH databases into one archive
./scripts/backup-database.sh backup

# List all backups
./scripts/backup-database.sh list

# Restore from a backup archive
./scripts/backup-database.sh restore backups/database/trackhub_backup_20260711_120000.tar.gz

# Cleanup old backups (keep last 7 days)
./scripts/backup-database.sh cleanup 7
```

### Backing Up Uploaded Documents

`backup-database.sh` covers PostgreSQL only. Documents uploaded through the document
management feature live on the **`manager-documents`** Docker volume and are the only
stateful data *outside* the database. Back the volume up separately:

```bash
# Find the volume (its name is prefixed with the compose project name)
docker volume ls | grep manager-documents

# Archive it
docker run --rm -v <volume-name>:/data -v "$PWD/backups:/backup" alpine \
  tar czf /backup/documents-$(date +%F).tar.gz -C /data .
```

### Which Build Is Deployed?

The **portal** reports its own build, because it is served as static files from a volume —
the image tag on disk cannot tell you what a browser actually loaded:

- **Footer** (`v1.1.0`) on every screen that renders it.
- **`https://your-domain.com/status`** — *"Portal build: v1.1.0 · 2026-07-28 14:32 UTC"*,
  under the bookmark hint. This page needs **no sign-in**, which is what makes it the check
  to use during an update window.

The version comes from `TrackHub/package.json` and the timestamp from the moment
`vite build` ran, so **two builds of the same version are still distinguishable** — you do
not have to bump `package.json` to tell one deployment apart from another.

**Backend services do not report a version.** They are identified by their image tags:
`./scripts/rollback.sh list` and `docker compose ps` are the authority for what is running.

### Version Management & Rollback

Rollback is **image-level**: it re-points a service's `:latest` tag at an older image and
recreates the container. It does **not** touch the database — see the caveat at the end of
this section.

Both `tag` and `rollback` take a **service name** plus the tag. There is **no `delete`
command**. All four sub-commands accept an optional compose file as the last argument
(`docker-compose.backend.yml` / `docker-compose.frontend.yml` on split deployments).

```bash
# Tag a service's current image before making changes
./scripts/rollback.sh tag manager v1.0.0

# List tagged versions
./scripts/rollback.sh list

# Show a service's image history
./scripts/rollback.sh history manager

# Roll a service back to a previous tag
./scripts/rollback.sh rollback manager v1.0.0
```

#### The `:previous` safety net

`deploy.sh --build` and `update-service.sh` **rebuild `<project>-<service>:latest` in
place**. The image being replaced keeps no tag of its own and becomes dangling, so an
untagged deployment is unrecoverable. Both scripts therefore tag every image they are about
to overwrite as **`:previous`** first, giving you a one-step rollback with no preparation:

```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh rollback frontend previous
```

`:previous` only ever holds **the last** deployment — the next update overwrites it. Tag a
named version (`rollback.sh tag frontend v1.1.0`) for anything you want to keep across
several updates.

#### Rolling back an update — step by step

The frontend is used here because the portal version makes each step visible; the same
sequence applies to any service.

```bash
cd /opt/trackhub/TrackHub.Deployment

# 1. Record what is running now. Note the portal build shown at /status.
./scripts/rollback.sh history frontend
curl -k https://your-domain.com/status      # or just open it in a browser

# 2. Give the current image a name you will recognise later.
#    (Optional — :previous is created automatically in step 3 — but a named tag
#     survives further updates.)
./scripts/rollback.sh tag frontend v1.1.0

# 3. Update. The outgoing image is preserved as frontend:previous.
./scripts/update-service.sh frontend

# 4. Confirm the NEW build is live: hard-reload /status (Ctrl+Shift+R) and check that
#    "Portal build" changed. The service worker-less SPA is cached by the browser, so a
#    plain reload can still show the old assets.
```

Then roll back:

```bash
# 5. Roll back to either tag. The command prompts for confirmation and saves the
#    version it is replacing as :pre-rollback-<timestamp>.
./scripts/rollback.sh rollback frontend previous     # or: ... frontend v1.1.0

# 6. Verify: /status must report the ORIGINAL build again (hard-reload), and the
#    container must be up.
docker compose ps frontend
./scripts/health-check.sh your-domain.com
```

Notes that matter when the rolled-back service is the frontend:

- nginx serves the SPA from the shared `trackhub-frontend` volume and is **not** restarted.
  The frontend container's entrypoint re-copies the image's build output into that volume on
  every start, so the rollback reaches nginx without any further action.
- **Hard-reload the browser.** `index.html` is small and often cached; without a hard reload
  you can see the old version string and conclude the rollback failed when it did not.

#### What rollback does *not* cover

- **The database is never rolled back.** Migrations are forward-only and `rollback.sh` does
  not run any. Rolling code back **across a migration** puts an older binary on a newer
  schema — usually tolerable (EF ignores columns it does not know) but not guaranteed. For a
  release that added a migration, restore from `backup-database.sh` if the schema itself has
  to go back.
- **Configuration is not rolled back.** `generated/appsettings.*.json` are produced from
  `.env` by `sync-config.sh`; an older image starting against newer config is still reading
  the newer config.
- **Seed data is not rolled back.** `db-init` seeds idempotently and only ever adds.

Let's Encrypt certificates auto-renew via a daily cron job set up by `generate-certs.sh`. The renewal uses the webroot method (no downtime).

```bash
# Check renewal status
./scripts/renew-ssl.sh

# Verify auto-renewal cron
crontab -l | grep renew-ssl
```

### Service Management

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Deploy/start all services (cached, deterministic builds + forced recreation)
./scripts/deploy.sh full --build

# Restart specific service
docker compose restart manager

# View service status
docker compose ps
```

### Resource Monitoring

```bash
# Container resource usage
docker stats

# System resources
htop
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Every API answers 404 through nginx, but works when called directly

nginx resolves the container names in its `upstream` blocks once, at startup, and open-source
nginx never re-resolves them. If backend containers were restarted by hand (`docker compose
restart`, `docker restart`, a crash loop), they may have new IPs and nginx keeps proxying to the
old ones - `/Identity/health` returns 404 from whichever container inherited the address, and
`docker compose ps` shows nginx unhealthy. Fix: restart nginx so it resolves again.

```bash
docker compose restart nginx
```

`deploy.sh` never hits this: it recreates nginx together with the services.

#### Build dies with "failed to execute bake: signal: killed"

The kernel OOM-killed the parallel image build. `deploy.sh` and `update-service.sh` now build one
image at a time (`COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT=1`); if it still dies, add swap before deploying:

```bash
fallocate -l 4G /swapfile && chmod 600 /swapfile && mkswap /swapfile && swapon /swapfile
```

Already-built images are cached, so re-running the deploy resumes where it stopped.

#### Services won't start

```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs --tail=100

# Check specific service
docker logs trackhub-authority
```

#### A service still runs old code after an update

This should not happen with the current deployment: `.dockerignore` files keep
stale host `bin/`/`obj/`/`node_modules/` out of the build so layer caching detects
real source changes, the frontend refreshes its static assets from the image on
every start, and containers are always force-recreated. If you still suspect
staleness:

```bash
# 1. Confirm the latest code was actually pulled
git -C /opt/trackhub log -1 --oneline

# 2. Redeploy (normal cached build already rebuilds changed services)
./scripts/deploy.sh full --build

# 3. Only if you must bypass the cache entirely (rarely needed)
./scripts/deploy.sh full --build --no-cache
```

You should **not** need to delete repositories, remove volumes, or run the deploy
command multiple times.

#### Database connection issues

```bash
# Test connectivity from container
docker exec -it trackhub-authority ping db-server.com

# Check environment variables
docker exec -it trackhub-authority env | grep ConnectionStrings
# (DB_CONNECTION_* exists only on the db-init container; services get ConnectionStrings__*)
```

#### Certificate issues

```bash
# Verify certificate files exist
ls -la certificates/

# Test certificate
openssl x509 -in certificates/fullchain.pem -text -noout
```

#### CORS errors

1. Check `ALLOWED_CORS_ORIGINS` in `.env`
2. Ensure frontend URL matches exactly (including protocol)
3. Check nginx configuration

#### OpenIddict HTTPS error (ID2083)

If you see `error:invalid_request` with `This server only accepts HTTPS requests`:

1. The Authority Server needs `ForwardedHeaders` middleware to trust nginx's `X-Forwarded-Proto` header
2. Ensure `UseForwardedHeaders` is called **before** `UseHttpsRedirection` in `Program.cs`
3. This is required because nginx terminates SSL and forwards HTTP internally

#### Restore failures in Docker (missing TrackHubCommon)

If `dotnet restore` fails because `Common.*` projects cannot be found: TrackHubCommon is a
`ProjectReference` — there is no packing stage and no local NuGet feed — so this almost
always means the build context is wrong or incomplete.

1. Verify `TrackHubCommon/` exists at the root of the checkout (the docker build context,
   `context: ..`) — `./scripts/clone-repos.sh` verifies this and names any missing directory
2. A `COPY` failure like `"/TrackHubCommon/...": not found` means the checkout is
   partial — re-run `./scripts/clone-repos.sh`
3. Ensure stale host build artifacts (`bin/`, `obj/`) are not leaking into the build
   context (they are excluded by the `.dockerignore` files)

#### 502 Bad Gateway

1. Check if backend service is running: `docker compose ps`
2. Check service logs: `docker logs trackhub-<service>`
3. Verify network connectivity between containers

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```bash
# Add to service environment in docker-compose.yml
environment:
  - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
  - Logging__LogLevel__Default=Debug
```

### Reset Deployment

> 🛑 **`-v` is destructive and irreversible.** It deletes the Docker volumes, which means:
> - **`manager-documents`** — *every uploaded document*. This data is **not** in PostgreSQL
>   and **not** covered by `backup-database.sh`. Archive it first (see
>   [Backing Up Uploaded Documents](#backing-up-uploaded-documents)).
> - **`db-init-flag`** — removing it **re-arms the one-time User/Account ID sync**, which
>   rewrites user and account IDs on the next deploy against your existing databases.
>
> For a normal restart use `docker compose down --remove-orphans` (no `-v`).

Only if you genuinely want to discard all local container state:

```bash
# Stop and remove everything INCLUDING volumes (see warning above)
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans

# Remove all images
docker system prune -a

# Re-deploy
./scripts/deploy.sh full --build
```

## Security Considerations

> **⚠️ Development secrets are committed on purpose.** The repositories ship with generic
> development credentials (OAuth client secrets in `ClientSeeder/clients.json`, sample
> appsettings, `.env` examples, seeded users) so the multi-service development environment can
> be stood up without manual secret plumbing. **They are for local/dev use only** — every
> production deployment must replace them via environment variables and the steps below
> (regenerate client secrets, strong DB/certificate passwords).

1. **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
2. **Use strong passwords** for database and certificates
3. **Rotate the seeded OAuth client secrets** (`syncworker_client`, `router_client`,
   `security_client`, `geofence_client`, `trip_client`) before
   exposing any environment beyond local development
4. **Keep Docker and OS updated** with security patches
5. **Use Let's Encrypt** for production SSL certificates
6. **Configure firewall** to only allow necessary ports
7. **Regular backups** of configuration and database
8. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
