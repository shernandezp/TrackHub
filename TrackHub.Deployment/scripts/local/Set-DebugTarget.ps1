.SYNOPSIS
    Point one TrackHub service at the Visual Studio debugger on the host, while the
    rest of the stack keeps running in Docker.

.DESCRIPTION
    Rewrites nginx/local.d/upstreams/<service>.conf so the reverse proxy sends that
    path to host.docker.internal:<port> instead of the container, stops the now
    redundant container, and reloads nginx.

    The result: the portal at https://localhost:3000 keeps calling exactly the same
    URLs, but requests for the one service under test land on your breakpoint.

        Browser -> https://trackhub.local:8443/Router/graphql
                -> nginx -> host.docker.internal:5003 -> Visual Studio (breakpoint)

    The other half - your host-run service calling its Docker peers - is covered by
    the published host ports. Use -ShowConfig to print the settings that service needs.

    Reverse it with -Reset, which restores the container upstream and starts it again.

.PARAMETER Service
    Compose service name: authority, security, manager, router, geofencing,
    tripmanagement, telemetry, reporting.

.PARAMETER Port
    The HTTP port your service listens on when debugging. Defaults to the http URL in
    that project's launchSettings.json. Use the HTTP port, not the HTTPS one - nginx
    talks to it over plain HTTP, which avoids a second certificate to trust.

.PARAMETER Reset
    Restore the service to its Docker container.

.PARAMETER ShowConfig
    Print the configuration the host-run service needs to reach its Docker peers.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Set-DebugTarget.ps1 -Service router -ShowConfig
    .\Set-DebugTarget.ps1 -Service router -Reset
