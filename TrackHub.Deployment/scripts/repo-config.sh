# Source checkout configuration
# =============================================================================
# The whole product lives in ONE repository. This file used to list the sibling
# repositories to clone; it now describes that single repository plus the
# top-level directories the image builds expect to find inside it.
#
# Layout contract — deliberately UNCHANGED from the polyrepo layout. This is why
# the compose files and every Dockerfile needed no edits: the build context
# (`context: ..`) is still a directory containing TrackHub/, TrackHubCommon/,
# TrackHub.Manager/ and friends as siblings of TrackHub.Deployment/.
#
#   <workspace>/                 <- monorepo checkout == docker build context
#     TrackHub/                  <- portal
#     TrackHubCommon/            <- shared packages
#     TrackHub.Manager/          <- service
#     TrackHub.Deployment/       <- this directory; compose runs from here
#     ...
#
# Usage:  source "$SCRIPT_DIR/repo-config.sh"
#         monorepo_url                  -> clone URL, credentials included
#         monorepo_url_clean            -> same URL without credentials
#         monorepo_clone_or_update DIR  -> clone into DIR if missing, else fast-forward
#         missing_source_dirs [DIR]     -> names any required directory that is absent
#         "${TRACKHUB_REPOS[@]}"        -> source directories the image builds require
# =============================================================================

# Top-level directories that must be present for the images to build. These keep
# the old variable name (and the old values) because they are still exactly the
# paths the Dockerfiles COPY from — only their provenance changed.
