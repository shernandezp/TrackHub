/// The default <see cref="IServiceOrderValidator"/>: accepts any reference, because spec 12 owns
/// service orders and there is no store in this module to consult. Inventing a cross-service call
/// here was rejected — spec 12 has not defined the contract, and TripManagement must not grow a
/// dependency on a module that does not exist yet.
/// <para>
/// <b>This is a deliberate, bounded permissiveness, not an oversight.</b> It is safe only because
/// the call sites are already correct: <c>CreateTripCommand</c> and <c>UpdateTripCommand</c> ask
/// this port on every write, so the day spec 12 registers a real implementation the reference is
/// enforced everywhere at once, with no handler reopened and nothing to remember. Registration is a
/// plain <c>AddScoped</c> in the Application layer; spec 12's implementation registers in the
/// Infrastructure layer, which runs afterwards and therefore wins.
