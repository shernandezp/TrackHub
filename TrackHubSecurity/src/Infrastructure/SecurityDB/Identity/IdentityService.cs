    // and a single user is raised above their role (e.g. one dispatcher who may delete trips) by
    // attaching a policy instead of widening the role for everyone who holds it. It composes the
    // other way too — a policy can grant an action no role has.

    // reading, and they inverted the operator's intent: attaching a policy to a resource/action
    // silently revoked it from every caller who did not hold that policy — Administrator's grant-all
    // included, since nothing here bypasses the check. Nothing depended on that behaviour
    // (resource_action_policy and user_policy were both empty), and GetAuthorizedActionsQuery already
    // reported permissions as role UNION policy — grant semantics — so enforcement now matches the
