// SuperAdministrators and Managers see the "GPS synchronisation" tile, because it pairs with the
// gpsIntegration dashboard Managers already own. The response is deliberately platform-wide and
// carries ONLY timestamps and counts — never an account id, name, or operator — so a Manager
// learns that the worker is alive, not who it synced for. The jobs table and announcement
// management stay Administrative/Read (Administrator-only).
