# Portal end-to-end suite (Playwright)

The regression gate for `TrackHub.Portal`. It drives the **real** portal in a
real browser against the **real** deployed stack: it signs in through the actual
OAuth flow, opens every screen, exercises the primary action of each one, and
checks that what it did survived a reload.

There are no mocked backends. `page.route` appears in exactly three places and
only ever to *break* something on purpose — a failed `/health` probe, a forced
`FORBIDDEN`, a forced `ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` — never to fake a success.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **The backend stack is up.**

   ```powershell
   cd TrackHub\TrackHub.Deployment
   .\scripts\local\Start-TrackHubLocal.ps1
   ```

   `TrackHub.Deployment/LOCAL-DOCKER.md` covers first-time setup (certificates,
   the `127.0.0.1 trackhub.local` hosts entry, the generated appsettings).

2. **The portal serves HTTPS.** `cert.crt` and `cert.key` must exist in
   `TrackHub.Portal/` — without them Vite silently falls back to HTTP and the
   OAuth callback fails. The setup script installs them.

3. **Browsers installed.**

   ```bash
   npm run e2e:install
   ```

The suite starts the dev server itself (`npm start`) unless `E2E_REUSE_SERVER=1`
tells it to use one that is already running.

---

## Running

```bash
npm run e2e                     # the whole suite
npm run e2e -- e2e/specs/50-geofences.spec.ts    # one file
npm run e2e -- --project=chromium-es             # the Spanish pass only
npm run e2e -- -g "creates a unit"               # by test name
npm run e2e:headed              # watch it
npm run e2e:ui                  # the Playwright UI runner
npm run e2e:report              # open the last HTML report
```

`E2E_REUSE_SERVER=1 npm run e2e` is the fast loop when `npm start` is already
running in another terminal.

A failure leaves a trace, a screenshot and a video under `test-results/`:

```bash
npx playwright show-trace test-results/<test>/trace.zip
```

---

## Configuration

Copy `e2e/.env.e2e.example` to `e2e/.env.e2e` (gitignored) and edit. **Every
value is optional** — the defaults drive the seeded local stack. Backend URLs are
never configured here: they are read from the portal's own `.env`/`.env.local`
through Vite's `loadEnv`, so the tests always talk to the same services the app
under test is pointed at.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `E2E_BASE_URL` | Portal origin. Defaults to the origin of `REACT_APP_CALLBACK_ENDPOINT`. |
| `E2E_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | The signing-in administrator. Defaults to the seeded `email@mail.com` / `12345678`. |
| `E2E_MANAGER_EMAIL` / `E2E_MANAGER_PASSWORD` | An existing Manager account, for the role-gate tests. |
| `E2E_USER_EMAIL` / `E2E_USER_PASSWORD` | An existing plain-User account, for the role-gate tests. |
| `E2E_REUSE_SERVER=1` | Use an already-running `npm start` instead of launching one. |
| `E2E_RUN_ID` | Override the run marker (normally the start time in base 36). |
| `E2E_SWEEP_ALL=1` | Let the global teardown also sweep this run's own `e2e-*` rows. |

### Tests that are conditional, and why

| Variable | Unskips | Why it is opt-in |
|---|---|---|
| `E2E_HAS_POSITIONS=1` | Dashboard history replay | Positions come from the Router sync workers and real GPS providers; with no recorded points there is no replay to assert. |
| `E2E_GPS_OPERATOR_ID` | The manual GPS synchronisation | A sync needs working provider credentials; it cannot be simulated. |
| `E2E_TRIP_IN_TRANSIT_ID` | The pause/resume exception verbs | The trip lifecycle is GPS-driven (spec 11a); a browser cannot make a truck leave a zone. |
| `E2E_CREATE_ACCOUNT=1` | The feature-gate test | Toggling a feature is account-wide; the shared master account is not changed by default. |
| `E2E_ALLOW_GEOCODING_SWITCH=1` | Activating a geocoding provider | The active provider is platform-wide, affecting every account. |
| `E2E_ALLOW_ROLE_MATRIX_WRITE=1` | Granting/revoking a ROLE permission | A role grant widens what every holder may do. The POLICY matrix — additive grants that cannot dent the mandatory baseline — is exercised unconditionally instead. |
| `E2E_ALLOW_PASSWORD_CHANGE=1` | Changing the administrator's password | One-way door unless `E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD` itself meets the platform policy (8+ chars, upper, lower, digit): the Security validator refuses to set a weaker one back, and the seeded `12345678` is weaker. |
| `E2E_MANAGER_*` / `E2E_USER_*` | The role-gate tests | A user created through the UI can never sign in — nothing in the platform sets `security.users.verified`. See the findings. |
| `E2E_SCANNER=1` | reserved | The document scanner's final state; the upload surface is currently unreachable (see findings). |

## How sessions work

The portal keeps its access token **in memory** and its refresh token in React
state, so a saved storage state restores no session by itself. What it does
restore is the AuthorityServer's own cookie, and that is enough: the portal's
`/authorize` round trip then completes with no login form and the callback mints
a fresh token pair.

Consequences the suite is built around:

- The `setup` project types credentials **once per role** and writes
  `e2e/.auth/{admin,manager,user}.json` plus the captured tokens. Nothing else
  ever types a password — `AuthContext.login()` allows 3 attempts per 30 s.
- **A deep link cannot be typed.** Every document load re-runs the OAuth round
  trip, and the callback navigates to `/dashboard` unconditionally, dropping the
  requested route. `Shell.open(key)` therefore lands on the dashboard and then
  *clicks* the sidenav entry, which is a client-side navigation.
- `Shell.reloadTo(key)` is how "did it really persist?" is asked: it reloads
  (dropping the in-memory token) and comes back through the dashboard.

To refresh the stored sessions, delete `e2e/.auth/` — the `setup` project
recreates it on the next run (it already clears stale states each run).

---

## Test data

Everything a test creates carries `e2e-<runId>-<n>` in the field a human reads,
where `runId` is the run's start time in base 36. Two things follow: a run can
find exactly its own rows, and a row's **age** is derivable from its name.

- Each test registers the undo for a row as soon as the row exists, so a later
  assertion failure still releases it (`fixtures/data.ts`).
- The global teardown deletes the principals the setup created and then sweeps
  `e2e-*` rows left by earlier, crashed runs (`fixtures/sweep.ts`).
- Trips are released with **delete → abort → cancel** in that order: delete is
  refused once a trip has history, abort is refused from `Created`, and cancel is
  the only verb that retires a queued trip that already acquired events
  (spec 11b). A leftover `Created` trip silently absorbs its unit's arming slot.
- **A cancelled trip's row is permanent.** Once a trip has history the backend
  answers `TRIP_HAS_HISTORY` to every delete, through any surface. The test that
  exercises the cancel verb therefore leaves a `Cancelled` row behind. It is
  inert — arming only ever considers `Created` trips — but it is the one thing
  the suite creates and cannot take back.

  specs/support/      helpers that are not tests
```

## Adding a screen

1. **Give its sections a key.** Pass `sectionKey="…"` to `TableAccordion`; the
   control renders `data-testid="section-<key>"`, `-header` and `-add`. Do not
   add ids to individual dialogs — the shared dialogs already carry
   `dialog-form`, `dialog-confirm`, `dialog-message`, `dialog-dynamic-table`,
   `dialog-help`, and table rows carry `row-<entityId>`.
2. **Write the test as a requirement.** The name should read like one: *"a
   manager creates a unit and sees it in the fleet list after reload"*.
3. **Select by role and localized name.** `getByRole('button', { name:
   t('generic.add') })`. The `t` fixture is bound to the project's language, so
   the same body runs in `chromium` and `chromium-es`.
4. **Assert the visible outcome AND the reload.** A closed dialog is not proof
   that anything was stored — `CrudFlow.reload(shell, screen)` then re-assert.
5. **Register the cleanup as soon as the row exists**, with an API fallback for
   rows the UI cannot delete (drivers, notification rules, document types and
   toll classes are deactivated, not deleted).
6. **Never wait on network idle.** Wait on the UI state you expect.

### MUI specifics you will hit

- `Select` opens a listbox in a portal: `page.getByRole('option', …)`, and the
  first option is a disabled placeholder — `FormDialog.selectFirst(id)` skips it.
- `Switch` has role **`switch`**, not `checkbox`.
- Icon-only buttons have **no accessible name** (MUI marks `Icon` `aria-hidden`),
  which is why the pagination controls carry `data-testid`.
- Tables inside a section page **ten rows at a time in the browser**;
  `Section.findRowAnyPage` walks them.
- The configurator drawer is always mounted, so a page-wide
  `getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' })` can match it. Scope to the card.
- The Configurator's Save calls `window.alert` — register `page.on('dialog')`
  before clicking.

### Preconditions that are easy to get wrong

Two of these cost a full re-run each, so they are worth knowing before writing a
test that seeds data:

- **Units are group-scoped.** Every unit picker on the trip screen is fed by
  `transporterLookupByUser`, so a unit created through the API without group
  membership is invisible to the signed-in user and never offered. Use
  `api.visibleTransporters()` and pick one the user can already see.
- **A driver is assignable only to a trip on a unit it is linked to.**
  `ValidateDriverAssignment` matches the driver's default transporter (or a live
  assignment) against the trip's; anything else is refused with
  `TRIP_DRIVER_NOT_ASSIGNABLE`, the toast is easy to miss, and the panel simply
  keeps saying "No driver assigned yet". Seed the driver with
  `api.createDriver(name, transporterId)` and plan the trip on that unit.
- **Assert inside the panel, not the page.** The picker keeps showing the name
  it selected whether or not the write was accepted, so a page-wide
  `getByText(name)` passes on a refusal. Scope to `panel-assignment`.
- **Client-paged sections need `findRowAnyPage`.** `findRow` looks at the
  rendered page only; a section that was short enough yesterday silently stops
  finding its row once another test seeds a few more.

---

### Deviations from spec 30 §7, and why

- **§3 page objects.** Most screens are driven through the SHARED controls they
  are actually built from (`tableAccordion`, `dialogs`, `crud`) rather than one
  object per screen; a per-screen file exists only where a screen has logic of
  its own. Nine near-identical wrappers around `Section` would be indirection,
  not abstraction.
- **§7.5 "protocol types must match `protocolTypes.ts`".** That file no longer
  exists — the portal carries no local protocol list. The picker is fed by the
  Router's `ProviderCapabilityCatalog`, so the test compares the offered options
  against that catalog instead, and asserts a reserved (capability-less) entry is
  never offered.
- **§7.12 "revoke the token via the API mid-test".** The refresh grant is failed
  at the network boundary instead. Revoking the shared administrator's refresh
  token would invalidate the session every other test in the worker signs in
  with; the portal path under test (`handleRefreshToken` → auth error → restart
  login) is identical either way.
- **Blocked by defects, not by the suite.** Report preview/export (§7.9) cannot
  be asserted beyond the failure while the Reporting service answers HTTP 500;
  units cannot be created from the portal (§7.4), so every test needing one seeds
  it through the API; a user created through the UI is never marked verified, so
  the "Add is absent without write permission" proof and the lock/unlock flow
  skip with that reason rather than assert a false pass.
- **Found by this suite, pinned as `test.fail()`.** Trip create and edit never
  reach the trip history (`TripWriter` raises the domain event but appends no
  `TripEvent` row, so the History tab omits both while the portal ships a label
  for each); and the document panel is never handed the account's document types
  (`DriverQualifications` mounts `DocumentPanel` without `categories`, which
  defaults to `[]`), so its upload dialog degrades to a free-text category and
  the Document Types section governs nothing.
- **Not covered.** Branding logo upload and its reflection in the shell, the
  >500-geofence page drain, the report truncation notice (needs data), the
  document panel's version/signature surfaces, and per-feature sidenav proof for
  all six feature keys (one is proven; the rest need `E2E_CREATE_ACCOUNT`).

Tests marked `test.fail()` are **known defects**: the assertion states the
correct behaviour, the annotation keeps the suite usable as a gate, and Playwright
turns the run red the moment the behaviour is fixed and the annotation goes
stale. Each one names its finding in a comment at the top of the test.
